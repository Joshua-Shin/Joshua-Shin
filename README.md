### 💼 Work Experience

#### **Tmax Tibero** | Database Engine Developer (Oct 2023 – Present)

**1) OpenSQL Team (Nov 2024 – Present)**
PostgreSQL-based managed RDBMS with Oracle compatibility and vector DB features.

- **Row-Level Security (DBMS_RLS)**  
  Designed and implemented Oracle-compatible RLS as a **PostgreSQL C extension**, using **planner_hook** and **object_access_hook** for planner integration and runtime policy enforcement. Delivered transient-view–style predicate injection and definer-rights policy execution aligned with Oracle VPD semantics.

- **Oracle compatibility**  
  Implemented Oracle-compatible functions/packages and conducted performance benchmarking; achieved measurable improvements including 50%+ gain for the median function through algorithm redesign.

- **Vector DB & RAG**  
  Integrated pgvector, developed vector embedding features, and implemented LLM integration for DB-based RAG solutions.

- **High availability**  
  Designed PostgreSQL HA environments using Patroni and etcd for enterprise workloads.

- **Cluster orchestration & scaling**  
  Architected a Multi-CSP IaC (ARM/CloudFormation) scaling engine using etcd watch for real-time state sync and Command Pattern–based rollback for transactional reliability in distributed node lifecycle.

- **Debug / monitoring**  
  Built internal debug tooling to print PostgreSQL query trees during development.

**2) SuperTibero Team (Oct 2023 – Oct 2024)**
Enterprise RDBMS with distributed storage; focused on SQL compiler modules.

- **SQL compiler**  
  Built parser, query transformer, and cost-based optimizer.

- **Query optimization**  
  Implemented index range scan, predicate pushdown, sort-skip optimization, and execution plan cache.

- **Privilege & authentication**  
  Designed and implemented privilege check and authentication for secure SQL execution.

- **Performance**  
  Delivered query transformation features that improved index scan opportunities and reduced redundant operations.
